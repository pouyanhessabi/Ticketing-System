# Ticketing System
The Ticketing System repository on GitHub implements a basic ticketing system using Python, flask framework and HTML and Restful API. Here are the key features and components of the system:

# Overview
Purpose: The system is designed to manage tickets, which could pertain to customer support or issue tracking.
Technologies Used:
Python: Main programming language for backend logic.
HTML: Used for creating the user interface.
# Key Components
## Files and Structure:
main.py: Likely the main entry point for the application.
auth.py: Handles authentication functionality.
model.py: Contains data models used in the application.
ticket.py: Manages ticket-related operations.
jira_actions.py: Possibly integrates with JIRA for ticket management.
exceptions.py: Defines custom exceptions for better error handling.
static and templates: Directories for static files (CSS, JS) and HTML templates, respectively.
## Database:
The system may utilize a database, as indicated by the presence of a .sql file (snappfood.sql), which suggests it configures the database schema.
# Functionality:
Users can create, view, and manage tickets.
Authentication for users to secure the system.
Integration capabilities with other platforms (like JIRA).
# Usage
The system is structured to facilitate user interaction through web-based interfaces, allowing for efficient ticket management.
This repository serves as a foundational implementation, which can be expanded with additional features based on specific requirements.
